Allows adding custom form fields to posts, storing them in custom meta fields. Integrates NGG, WT, and WP-DM.

== Description ==

This plugin takes a simple concept of giving you fields to enter information that use the meta tags built into 
Wordpress and expands on it. Modifying conf.ini in the plugin directory will allow you to enter custom fields to 
the Posts pages to add textfields, textarea, dropdown selections, checkboxes, and radio selections.

On top of all this simplicity, it also integrates several popular Wordpress plugins. With gallery selection for 
NextGen Gallery you can select a gallery to save the id to a meta field for your post to pull in your theme. Support 
for WordTube video selection is also added. WP-Download Manager is also supported in this initial release to get ids 
for downloads as well.

Now while that may seem enough to make this a popular plugin, there is more. Meta Extensions allows you mark the 
fields to auto add tags based on field title or content (explained in the readme). It also allows you to set up 
checkboxes to add a post to/remove from a category automatically as wanted. All from the single Conf.ini file included 
with the plugin.

= CONFIGURATION =

Filed/Element Types:
    textfield - HTML Form Textfield
	textarea  - HTML Form Textarea
	checkbox  - HTML Form Checkbox
	radio     - HTML Form Radio selections
	select    - HTML Form Select box
	gallery   - HTML Form Select box to choose a NextGen Gallery
	video     - HTML Form Select box to choose a Wordtube Video
	download  - HTML Form Select box to choose a Wordpress Download Manager file

To specify the custom fields, edit the file conf.ini

Each entry begins with the subject inside square brackets. The second 
line specifies its type. The third line, which only applies to type
"radio" and "select," enumerates the available options. Each option
has to be separated by a hash mark (#). Each entry for standard HTML
form entities you can also include a default which tells it which to
mark as selected or checked. You can also include the tag option which
will tell the plugin to add the selection as a post tag automatically.
Tags are explained further down. Checkbox also has unique entries called
category_id and category_name. These are filled based on existing categories
in your Wordpress site. This can be used to auto add/remove the post to the
entered category id (and it's matching name for error checks) when used.

Ex.

[Plan]
type = textfield
subtitle = Enter the generic name of your plan here.

[Favorite Post]
type = checkbox
category_id = 4
category_name = Project Plans

[Miles Walked]
type = radio
value = 0-9#10-19#20+
default = 0-9

[Temper Level]
type = select
value = High#Medium#Low

[Hidden Thought]
type = textarea
rows = 4
cols = 40

[Picture Gallery]
type = gallery
tag = 0

[The Video]
type = video
tag = 0

[Attachment]
type = download
tag = 0

Tags can be very useful. Below is how each special type generates the
tag for it.

Tag Design:
    textfield - Title of the entry when filled
	textarea  - Title of the entry when filled
	checkbox  - Title of the entry when checked
	radio     - The name of the selection
	select    - The name of the selection
	gallery   - Not handled
	video     - Not handled

= Useage =
Once you build your conf.ini file, you are ready to start making posts
using the custom fields. In order to call these fields you can either
use the built in get methods for post meta, or you can use the ones that
I have added to the metaext class to keep your code clean and know what
is what. Below is the current list of functions you can use in your theme
to call the meta information easily.

Meta Extensions Class:
	metaext::get_single_metaext($meta_name, $limit)
		Description: Creates a post object containing all the Posts with the meta_name passed being set in them.
			$meta_name: the name in brackets for the field you want to pull the list of posts using this field.
			$limit: how many of these posts to pull. Defaults to 5 if nothing is passed.
	metaext::get_multi_metaext($meta_names, $limit)
		Description: Creates a post object containing all the Posts the all the meta_names passed (meta_names is an array).
			$meta_names: the names in brackets in an array for the fields you want to pull the list of posts using this field.
			$limit: how many of these posts to pull. Defaults to 5 if nothing is passed.
	metaext:: get_value_metaext($the_ID, $name)
		Description: Gets the value for the passed name from the post id passed.
			$the_ID: the post ID you are wanting to pull the custom field's value from.
			$name: The field name of the entry you want to pull the value for. The name is what is in [] and is case sensitive.
	
Meta Extensions Wordpress Download Manager Class:
	metaext_wpdm::get_metaext_downloadlink($id)
		Description: Returns the download link for WPDM ID passed.
			$id: The download ID (can use metaext::get_value_metaext() to get the ID) you want the link for.
	metaext_wpdm::show_metaext_downloadlink($id)
		Description: Echos the download link for WPDM ID passed.
			$id: The download ID (can use metaext::get_value_metaext() to get the ID) you want the link for.
			
Meta Extensions NextGen Gallery Class:
	metaext_ngg::get_metaext_firstpic($galleryid)
		Description: Pulls the first image's src link for the gallery id passed to it.

	metaext_ngg::show_metaext_firstpic($galleryid, $class = '')

	metaext_ngg::show_metaext_gallery($galleryid)
